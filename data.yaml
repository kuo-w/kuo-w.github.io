            I purchased an item which enqueued me in a shipment queue, 
            of which the expected shipment was months out.
          - Luckily, the business owner published the shipment queue on a webpage.
          - I deployed a CRON on Google Cloud Functions which crawled the webpage daily and looked for my particular order.
          - Using Twilio, I then sent a text to my phone reporting my position in queue.
